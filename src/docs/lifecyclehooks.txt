Whenever a new component is created in Angular, when it finds one of our selectors:
It will instantiate a new version of that component and add it into the DOM, it goes through a couple of lifecycle hooks.

We can hook into these couple of phases of component creation process by implementing these lifecycle methods.

Angular will call our own implemention of these methods if present in our code. 

Lifecycle hooks:
 
1. ngOnChanges: called after a bound input property changes.
 It is called multiple times.
 Called at the start when a new component is created and thereafter whenever a bound input property changes.

 What I mean here is properties with @Input().

 Whenever these properties receives new values.
------------------------------------------------------------------
2. ngOnInit: called once the component is initialized.
This does not mean we can see it. It has not been added to the DOM yet. But Angular finished the basic initialization
Our properties can now be accessed and initialized. So the object was created.

ngOnInit will run after the constructor.

------------------------------------------------------------------

3. ngDoCheck: Called during every change detection run
 Called multiple time. Actually this will run a lot as this will run whenever change detection runs.

 Change Detection: It's a system by which Angular determines whether something changed on the template of a component or inside of a component.
 Whether Angular need to change something in the template. Whether some property value changed and that property is output on the UI.
Angular needs to rerender that part of the template.

ngDoCheck will run irrespective of any real change. Angular will check everytime user inteacts with UI, If any property changed it will render otherwise it won't.

But it has to check everytime to know whether the property value has changed or not.
ex: Clicked Somewhere, a timer fired, an observable resolved etc
------------------------------------------------------------------

4. ngAfterContentInit: Called after content (ng-content) has been projected into view. Called only once.

5. ngAfterContentChecked: Called every time the projected content has been checked.

6. ngAfterViewInit: Called after the component's view (and child views) has been initialized.

7. ngAfterViewChecked: Called everytime the (and child views) have been checked.

8. ngOnDestroy: Called once the component is about to be destroyed.

----------------- Sequence of lifecycle hooks ----------------------

1. constructor 
2. ngOnChanges
3. ngOnInit
4. ngDoCheck
5. ngAfterContentInit
6. ngAfterContentChecked
7. ngAfterViewInit
8. ngAfterViewChecked
9. ngOnDestroy - When you remove an object of your custom component type. It will destroy the component and before destroying it will run this hook.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

ngOnChanges is the only hook that receives an arguement of type: SimpleChanges.
The arguement is an object containing all the properties with @Input decorator and information about those properties(currentValue, previousValue, firstChange).


Good Practice: 
------------
If you're using a lifecycle hook make sure yor implement it's corresponding interface in your class definition.

Class ServerElement implement OnChanges, OnInit{
    ngOnInit(){......your code}
    ngOnChanges(){......your code}
}
